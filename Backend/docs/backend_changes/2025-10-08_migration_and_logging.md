# Backend Changes â€“ 2025-10-08

## Summary
This record consolidates the backend fixes applied on 2025-10-08 to restore migrations and server start-up. Store this file (and directory) with other project documentation to preserve the changes during any cleanup.

## Files Added
- `src/config/environment.js`
  - Loads environment variables via `dotenv` and exports a structured `config` object used by services (e.g., `email.service.js`).
- `src/scripts/migrate.js`
  - Node-based migration runner that provisions enums, tables, and indexes for PostgreSQL.
- `src/utils/logger.js`
  - Winston-backed logger shared by services (currently consumed by `email.service.js`).

## Files Modified
- `src/config/database.js`
  - Added `getStatus()` helper returning PostgreSQL/Redis status details for application-wide reporting.

## Usage Notes
- Run database migrations: `npm run migrate`.
- Start the backend: `npm start`. The new logger and status helper are required dependencies.
- Migration script reads credentials from `.env`; ensure DB variables remain configured.

## Preservation Guidance
Keep the entirety of this directory (`docs/backend_changes/`) under version control or backup storage. If performing cleanup operations, verify these files remain untouched:
1. `src/config/environment.js`
2. `src/scripts/migrate.js`
3. `src/utils/logger.js`
4. `src/config/database.js`

Re-applying or removing any of the above will break migrations or service initialization. Refer to this document before modifying backend infrastructure.
