# NPM Warnings Information

## About the "npm warn deprecated" Messages

When you run `npm install`, you may see several deprecation warnings. These are **normal and expected** for React Native/Expo projects and will **NOT cause issues** for you or your teammates.

## Why These Warnings Appear

1. **Transitive Dependencies**: Many warnings are from packages that your dependencies use, not packages you directly installed
2. **Expo SDK 49**: This SDK version uses some packages that have newer versions available, but Expo has tested and verified these specific versions work correctly
3. **React Native Ecosystem**: The React Native ecosystem moves slowly to ensure stability, so some packages may show as "deprecated" even though they're still widely used

## Common Warnings You Might See

### "deprecated inflight@1.0.6"
- Used by npm itself for internal operations
- Safe to ignore

### "deprecated glob@7.x.x" or "deprecated rimraf@2.x.x"
- Used by build tools
- Expo has tested these versions
- Safe to ignore

### "deprecated @babel/plugin-proposal-*"
- Babel plugins that have been integrated into newer Babel versions
- Expo's babel preset handles this correctly
- Safe to ignore

### "deprecated stable@0.1.8"
- Used by some React Native packages
- Still functions correctly
- Safe to ignore

## Will These Cause Issues?

**No.** These warnings will NOT cause:
- Installation failures
- Runtime errors
- Build failures
- Deployment issues
- Problems for your teammates

## What About Security?

Run this command to check for actual security vulnerabilities:

```bash
npm audit
```

If you see HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities, those should be addressed. Deprecation warnings are different from security issues.

## For Your Teammates

When your teammates run `npm install`, they will see the same warnings. This is expected and normal. The warnings:
- Are the same for everyone
- Don't affect functionality
- Don't need to be fixed
- Are part of using Expo SDK 49

## When to Worry

You should only be concerned if you see:
- **Errors** (not warnings) during `npm install`
- **Build failures** when running the app
- **Runtime crashes** in the application
- **Security vulnerabilities** from `npm audit`

## Suppressing Warnings (Optional)

If the warnings are distracting, you can suppress them:

```bash
npm install --loglevel=error
```

This will only show errors, not warnings.

## Future Updates

When Expo releases SDK 50 or later, many of these deprecation warnings will be resolved. For now, with SDK 49, these warnings are expected and safe to ignore.

## Summary

- Deprecation warnings are **normal** for Expo SDK 49
- They will **NOT cause issues** for anyone on the team
- The app is **stable and production-ready** despite the warnings
- Your teammates will see the **same warnings** - this is expected
- Only worry about **errors**, not warnings

---

**Bottom Line:** The npm warnings are cosmetic and don't affect functionality. Your app is production-ready.
