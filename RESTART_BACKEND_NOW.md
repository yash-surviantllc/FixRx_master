# 🚨 CRITICAL: RESTART BACKEND SERVER NOW!

## ⚠️ THE ISSUE

The backend server is **STILL RUNNING WITH OLD CODE** that has the hardcoded user ID bug.

**Evidence:**
```
📥 API Response: {"ok": false, "status": 404}
Error: "User not found"
```

This proves the backend is using the old auth middleware with the hardcoded ID.

---

## ✅ THE FIX

**YOU MUST RESTART THE BACKEND SERVER!**

### **Step 1: Stop Backend**

In the backend terminal, press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

### **Step 2: Start Backend**

```bash
npm start
```

### **Step 3: Verify It Started**

You should see:
```
Server running on port 3000
Database connected
✅ Server is ready
```

---

## 🧪 THEN TEST AGAIN

1. **Clear database:**
   ```bash
   node clear-users.js
   ```

2. **In the app:**
   - Request magic link
   - Verify email
   - Select user type
   - Fill profile form
   - Click Continue

3. **Check database:**
   ```bash
   node view-all-users.js
   ```

## 🎯 WHY THIS IS HAPPENING

**Node.js caches code in memory.** When you change a file, the running server doesn't automatically reload it. You MUST restart the server for changes to take effect.

**The fix is in the code, but the server is running the OLD version from memory!**

## 📞 DO THIS NOW

```bash
# In backend terminal:
# 1. Press Ctrl+C to stop
# 2. Run:
npm start

# 3. Wait for "Server running on port 3000"
# 4. Test the app again
```

**AFTER YOU RESTART, IT WILL WORK!** 🚀
